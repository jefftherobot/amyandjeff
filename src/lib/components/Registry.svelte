    <p>In lieu of traditional gifts, we invite you to celebrate our wedding by supporting causes close to our hearts.
			<br><br>
			We've chosen to include a couple donation options to nonprofits dedicated to neurodiversity, advocating for inclusion, understanding, and empowerment of neurodivergent individuals, as well as PFLAG, an organization committed to advancing equality and acceptance for LGBTQ+ individuals.
			<br><br>
		Your gift will help create a more accepting and supportive world for all minds and identitiesâ€”thank you for being part of something meaningful on our special day.</p>
