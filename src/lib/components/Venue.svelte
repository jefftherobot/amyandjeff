        <dd>The era that makes Rose Valley unique among the Philadelphia suburbs is that  of the Arts and Crafts movement. Generally defined as the English revival of  decorative arts, it was one aspect of a many-sided reaction against the Industrial Revolution and the diminished role of the craftsman in the production of goods. You will notice many of these Arts & Crafts details inside the mill and adjoining buildings. ~The Rose Valley Borough Historic Society</dd>
